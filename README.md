UPark-App
This project is for an application for the parking lot of the Universidad Latina de Costa Rica. It is a new idea that will help students and administrative crew to know how many spaces are available. The team interviewed several people trying to identify the problems that they have noticed on the parking lot. So we decided to create an application to provide a solution for those problems.
This app will be implemented in this semester as a final project for communications software course.
